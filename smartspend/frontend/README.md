## How to Run

1. Make sure you have **Node.js** installed (version 16 or higher recommended)
   - Download from: https://nodejs.org/

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the frontend folder:

   ```bash
   cd smartspend/frontend
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open your browser and go to the localhost address shown in the terminal.

   **Note:** The default port is `5173`, but if that port is in use, Vite will automatically try the next available port (5174, 5175, etc.). Check the terminal output for the exact URL:

   ```
   ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5190/
   ```

   Example addresses:
   - http://localhost:5173/
   - http://localhost:5174/
   - http://localhost:5175/
   - etc.
